# 3DRTM-PlanetScope-GAI
#### This is an improved 3D Radiative Transfer Model for GAI estimation based our previous study (Dong et al., 2024) . This approach integrates some prior information including canopy structure, leaf optical properties and soil background to improve the realism of the simulation. 

#### A suite of models (MARMIT-2 for soil reflectance, PROSPECT for leaf optical properties, ADEL-Wheat for canopy structure, and LESS for radiative transfer) was employed to generate five simulation datasets incorporating different combinations of prior information.

#### The details of the simulated dataset used to train the retrieval method
